# Lottery
**A lottery application which is small but strong.**

It can generate random numbers in the range you entered. You can set the `quantity` and even the numbers you want to `ignore`.

## Requirement
**A Windows equipment with `.NET Framework 4.8` or higher.**

However, sometimes you can still use it `without` the required environment due to some special things.

## Build & Run
**We advise you to use `Visual Studio` to build the project.**

If you only want to `use` it, please go to the [Release Page](https://github.com/Unqualified-Developers/Lottery/releases) or use the [Direct Download Links](https://github.com/Unqualified-Developers/Lottery?tab=readme-ov-file#downloads) below. The latest release is `v1.1.0.1`.
